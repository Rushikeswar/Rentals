# RentalsPro

## Description

RentalsPro is a web-based platform designed to simplify the process of renting products, including vehicles, electronics, and outdoor equipment. This project was motivated by the growing demand for flexible, short-term access to products without ownership commitments. RentalsPro was created to solve the problem of high rental costs by offering a centralized solution where users can find affordable rental options for various needs.

Through this project, we developed skills in building a full-stack application with separate frontend and backend functionality, using frameworks like React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.
